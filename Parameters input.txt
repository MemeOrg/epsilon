1. Initial attributes:
	IOP
	MD
	Referenced MD rate of decrease (population based)
	Age (of the population concerned)
	Death Age (annual incidence)
	Gender Ratio 
	
2. During Simulation:
	Medication annual IOP% reduction
	Medication annual Side effect
	IOP after trabeculectomy and implant
	Rate of increase IOP while not on medication 
	Rate of increase IOP after trabeculectomy/implant
	Time to next visit schedule - after medication and after surgery

	Cataract annual incidence (by gender/)
	Annual Probability of surgery to remove cataract
3. Important relationship 
	Equation linking MD with IOP
	Equation for conversion from OHT to POAG
4. Medical costs
	Treatment costs (w.r.t patients' current status)
	Care costs
	Discount rates

5. Important treatment schemas
